check-pw
============

This is a simple script for checking if a given string is contained in a
user's LastPass database without fetching passwords each time it's run,
and without exposing the users passwords.

I currently use this script with [CopyQ](http://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/)
to avoid storing known passwords.
